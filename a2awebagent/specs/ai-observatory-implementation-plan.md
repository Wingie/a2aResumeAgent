# 🎯 AI Agent Observatory Implementation Plan

**Project**: Complete Real-time Model Intelligence Platform  
**Status**: Phase 1 Day 1 - In Progress  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-01  

## 🎬 Vision: Ultimate Agent Evaluation Dashboard
Transform a2aTravelAgent into a comprehensive real-time observatory where AI models "think" and compete on live tasks, with complete visibility into decision-making, performance metrics, and visual actions.

## 🏗️ Current Implementation Status

### ✅ **Existing Infrastructure Discovered**
- **SSE Backend**: 3 working endpoints (`/agents/events`, `/evaluations/events`, `/api/admin/statistics/sse`)
- **SSE Frontend**: Basic EventSource connection with partial event handling
- **Database Schema**: Complete LLM tracking, evaluation, and task execution tables
- **Tool Framework**: MCP protocol with 9 active tools and auto-discovery

### ❌ **Key Gaps Identified**
- **Tool → TaskExecution**: MCP tool calls don't create TaskExecution records
- **Real-time Broadcasting**: Tools execute but only broadcast on 10s schedule
- **Frontend Consumption**: SSE events received but incomplete DOM updates
- **Decision Streaming**: LLM calls tracked but not streamed live

## 📋 PHASE-BY-PHASE IMPLEMENTATION

### 🏗️ **PHASE 1: Foundation Infrastructure (3 days)**

#### **Day 1: Backend Event Pipeline** ⚙️ *IN PROGRESS*
**Goal**: Wire MCP tool calls → TaskExecution creation → instant SSE broadcasting

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Located tool execution point: `JsonRpcHandler.handleCallTool()` line 79
- ✅ Identified SSE broadcasting infrastructure in `AgentDashboardController`
- ✅ Confirmed database schema and TaskExecution entity structure

**Tasks In Progress**:
- 🔄 Create `TaskExecutionIntegrationService` for MCP tool wrapping
- 🔄 Implement real-time SSE broadcasting triggers
- 🔄 Add enhanced event payloads with screenshots/progress/reasoning

**Implementation Details**:
```java
// Target Integration Point: JsonRpcHandler.handleCallTool() line 79
// Current: Object result = toolExecutor.execute(toolCall);
// New: Wrap with TaskExecution creation + SSE broadcasting
```

#### **Day 2: Frontend SSE Consumption** 📱 *PENDING*
**Goal**: Complete frontend SSE event handling with live UI updates

**Planned Tasks**:
- Complete `updateActiveTasks()` DOM manipulation
- Real-time screenshot gallery with thumbnails
- Progress bar animations during task execution
- Connection health indicators and offline handling

#### **Day 3: LLM Decision Streaming** 🧠 *PENDING*
**Goal**: Stream LLM calls and agent decision steps in real-time

**Planned Tasks**:
- Enhance `LLMCallTracker` to trigger SSE broadcasts
- Add reasoning extraction and structured decision display
- Live cost/token tracking with animated counters
- Decision quality scoring and confidence visualization

### 🚀 **PHASE 2: Model Observatory (4 days)** *PENDING*
**Goal**: Multi-model evaluation with comparative intelligence

**Key Features**:
- Parallel model evaluation dashboard
- Chain-of-thought parsing and reasoning quality scoring
- Visual intelligence with screenshot annotation
- Real-time performance analytics and comparison

### ⚡ **PHASE 3: Advanced Features (3 days)** *PENDING*
**Goal**: Interactive research tools and session replay

**Key Features**:
- Live task injection and mid-task interventions
- Model personality profiling and consensus analysis
- Complete session replay with reasoning archaeology
- Publication-ready comparative forensics

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Phase 1 Completion Criteria**:
- **< 1 second**: Tool execution → dashboard update latency
- **Real-time Screenshots**: New screenshots appear immediately in gallery
- **Live Progress**: Progress bars update smoothly during task execution
- **Decision Visibility**: LLM calls and reasoning displayed as they happen

### **Technical Architecture**:
```
MCP Tool Call → TaskExecution Creation → Progress Updates → SSE Broadcasting
                                      ↘ Screenshot Capture → Real-time Gallery
                                      ↘ LLM Decision Steps → Live Reasoning Stream
```

## 📝 **Development Notes**

### **Current Working Directory**: `/Users/wingston/code/a2aTravelAgent/a2awebagent`

### **Key Integration Points**:
1. **MCP Tool Execution**: `JsonRpcHandler.handleCallTool()` line 79
2. **SSE Broadcasting**: `AgentDashboardController.broadcastUpdate()` 
3. **Frontend Updates**: `agents-dashboard.html` SSE event handlers
4. **LLM Tracking**: `LLMCallTracker` AOP interceptor

### **Database Schema Status**:
- ✅ TaskExecution entity with screenshots, progress, status
- ✅ LLMCallLog entity with token usage, cost tracking
- ✅ AgentDecisionStep entity with reasoning and confidence
- ✅ All database tables created and indexed

### **Next Session Priorities**:
1. Complete TaskExecutionIntegrationService implementation
2. Test MCP tool → TaskExecution → SSE pipeline end-to-end
3. Fix frontend updateActiveTasks() DOM manipulation
4. Implement real-time screenshot streaming
