### 3. Multi-Step Execution Flow Analysis

**Execution Timeline Example (Travel Booking):**
```
Step 1: Navigate to https://www.booking.com (3.2s)
Step 2: Wait for page load and accept cookies (0.3s)
Step 3: Fill search form with details (0.4s)
Step 4: Click search button and wait (0.5s)
Step 5: Early completion triggered (confidence threshold met)
Total: 4.4s for 4 steps
```

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Average execution time: 1.2-4.6 seconds
- Step completion rate: 100%
- Early completion trigger rate: ~40% of AUTO mode tests
- Screenshot capture: 100% successful when enabled

### 4. State Management and Lifecycle

**Browser State Management:**
- ✅ Proper page creation and cleanup
- ✅ Event listener setup and teardown
- ✅ Session isolation between requests
- ✅ Memory management (no leaks observed)

**Workflow State Transitions:**
```
INITIALIZED → EXECUTING → STEP_PROCESSING → CAPTURING → COMPLETED
```

**Session Management:**
- Unique session IDs generated per execution
- Proper cleanup after completion
- Isolated state between concurrent requests

### 5. Network Interception and Monitoring

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Network request/response capture
- ✅ API response analysis

- ✅ Session-based activity tracking
- ✅ Cleanup mechanisms

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Full request/response lifecycle capture
- Content-type filtering for API responses
- Search-specific and auth-specific data extraction
- Session-isolated network activity storage

### 6. Early Completion Logic Analysis

**Threshold Testing:**
- Default threshold (0.8): Effective termination
- Custom thresholds (0.6): More aggressive completion
- Confidence scoring: Progressive improvement per step

**Completion Scenarios Observed:**
```
Step 1: Confidence 0.2
Step 2: Confidence 0.4  
Step 3: Confidence 0.6
Step 4: Confidence 0.8 → EARLY_COMPLETION_TRIGGERED
```
